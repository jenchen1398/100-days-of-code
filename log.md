# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: 1/2/2018

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked through 2 exercises in CTCI (1.1 and 1.2). Wrote pseudocode on paper. 
**Thoughts:** Getting started with coding interview practice was a bit difficult because I was overwhelmed by the amount of material I realized I'd have to relearn and practice. But after finishing these 2 problems, I realized that it was pretty interesting and I could definitely practice everyday and slowly build up my skills. 

## Day 2: 1/5/2018

**Today's Progress**: I reviewed 2 lectures on hashtables from data structures. 
**Thoughts:** I didn't intend to skip the last couple of days but ended up developing an unhealthy sleep schedule because of winter break. I will need to be more diligent in the future. Will actual code up a hashtable and my CTCI problems I wrote out tomorrow.

## Day 3: 1/6/2018

**Today's Progress**: Implemented a hashtable from scratch. Added linear probing to it. Implemented my solutions for CTCI 1.1. Reviewed data structures lecture on Trees and looked over StringBuilder.
**Thoughts:** Will implement a separate chaining hashtable tomorrow and work on CTCI linked list problems. I'm very used to coding in java in the Eclipse IDE so it's taking some getting used to coding in vim without the syntax highlighting etc.
